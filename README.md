# QuickSwitch

QuickSwitch a helper to quick switch workspaces and view render menu in viewport. The Pie menu can be adjusted using the order of the WM menu. Also shortcuts can be added to all workspaces making it very easy and fast to switch to preferred workspace. It also allows you to quick switch render engine using a popup menu.

Keepmode will store the object interaction mode. So for example when your in modeling workspace and are in weightpaint mode on returning you're still in weightpaint mode. The standard workflow for Blender is that this will be reset to the setting preset under Workspace Settings > Workspace > Mode. Storing this value speeds up your process by removing this repetitive move of returning to your last interacting mode when you left the workspace.

> Some limitations are currently present due to Beta containing some bugs
